## üí° The Vision: Making AI Safe for Everyone

Generative AI is revolutionary, but its deployment is plagued by critical vulnerabilities. From **prompt-injection attacks** and **sensitive data leaks** to **factual hallucinations** and the spread of **deepfakes**, the risks are immense. Nova solves this.

We are building a comprehensive, developer-first security and quality gateway. By acting as a smart proxy, Nova intercepts and analyzes every interaction with an LLM, ensuring that every prompt is safe and every response is secure, accurate, and aligned with ethical policies. Our mission is to provide the essential trust layer that will unlock the full potential of AI for businesses and the public alike.

## ‚ú® Key Features

Nova is architected as a modular platform, allowing us to layer on increasingly sophisticated protections.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Deep-Dive

Nova operates as a high-performance, asynchronous API proxy built on a "multi-critic" architecture. This design allows for parallel processing and defense-in-depth.

  *Image: High-level overview showing User App -> Nova (Inbound/Outbound Checks) -> LLM -> Nova -> User App*
</p>

1.  **Ingestion & Fast Path:** An incoming request is immediately checked against our **Qdrant**-powered Semantic Cache and Threat Vector database. This handles the majority of common requests and known attacks with millisecond latency.
2.  **Inbound Analysis:** If not cached, the prompt is sanitized and passed to our **Inbound Security Critic** (a `gpt-4-turbo` agent) to analyze intent and structure.
3.  **LLM Interaction:** The validated prompt is sent to the primary LLM.
4.  **Outbound Analysis (The Multi-Critic Pipeline):** The LLM's response is sent to a panel of specialized critics *in parallel* using `asyncio.gather` for maximum throughput. This includes critics for policy, factual accuracy, and source reputation.
5.  **Remediation & Logging:** A final verdict is reached. The action (ALLOW, BLOCK, WARN, REWRITE) is executed, and the entire transaction, including all metadata and critic reasoning, is logged to PostgreSQL with a **chained SHA-256 hash** to ensure immutability.

    *   The dependency manager for our Python backend.
*   **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)**: The latest version of Docker Desktop.
    *   Required to run our PostgreSQL and Qdrant database containers.


### Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/aegis-gateway.git
    cd aegis-gateway
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    # This installs both frontend and backend dependencies
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    ```bash
    # Copy the example environment files
    cp packages/backend/.env.example packages/backend/.env
    cp packages/frontend/.env.local.example packages/frontend/.env.local

    # Now, fill in the required values in both .env files
    ```

4.  **Launch Services with Docker Compose**
    *We use Docker Compose to run the database and other services locally.*
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

5.  **Run Database Migrations**
    *From within the `packages/backend` directory:*
    ```bash
    poetry run alembic upgrade head
    ```

6.  **Start the Development Servers**
    *From the root directory:*
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    Your application should now be running, with the frontend on `http://localhost:3000` and the backend on `http://localhost:8000`.
